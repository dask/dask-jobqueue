Deploy Dask on Job Queueing systems
===================================

This helps to deploy Dask on batch-style job schedulers like PBS, SGE and SLURM.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

   from dask_jobqueue import PBSCluster

   cluster = PBSCluster(project='...')
   cluster.start_workers(10)

   from dask.distributed import Client
   client = Client(cluster)

Adaptivity
----------

This can also adapt the cluster size dynamicaly based on current load.
This helps to scale up the cluster when necessary but scale it down and save
resources when not actively computing.

.. code-block:: python

   cluster.adapt()
