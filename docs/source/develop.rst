Install
-------

After setting up an environment as described in the `Dask developer
guidelines`_ you can clone this repository with git::

   git clone git@github.com:dask/dask-jobqueue.git

and install it from source::

   cd dask-jobqueue
   python setup.py install

Formatting
----------

When youâ€™re done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 checks and use black formatting::

   flake8 dask_jobqueue
   black dask_jobqueue

To get flake8 and black, just pip install them. You can also use pre-commit to add them as pre-commit hooks.

Test
----

Test using ``py.test``::

   py.test dask-jobqueue --verbose

Test with Job scheduler
-----------------------

Some tests require to have a fully functional job queue cluster running, this
is done through Docker_ and `Docker compose`_ tools. You must thus have them
installed on your system following their docs.

You can then use the same commands as Travis CI does for your local testing,
for example with pbs::

   source ci/pbs.sh
   jobqueue_before_install
   jobqueue_install
   jobqueue_script
