Common work-arounds
===================

The universe of HPC clusters is extremely diverse, with different job
schedulers, different configuration, different decisions (security, usage, etc...)
made by each HPC cluster. An unfortunate consequence of this is that this is
impossible for Dask-Jobqueue to cover all possible tiny edge cases of some HPC
clusters.

This page is an attempt to document work-arounds that are likely to be useful
on some clusters (strictly more than one ideally although hard to be sure ...).

Skipping unrecognised line in submission script with ``header_skip``
--------------------------------------------------------------------

On some clusters the submission script generated by Dask-Jobqueue (you can look
at it with ``print(cluster.job_script())``) may not work on your HPC cluster
because on some configuration quirk of your HPC cluster. Probably there are
some reasons behind this configuration quirk of course.

You'll get an error when doing ``cluster.scale`` (i.e. where you actually
submit some jobs) that will tell you your job scheduler is not happy with your
job submission script (see examples below). The main parameter you can use to
work-around this is ``header_skip``:

.. code-block:: python

   # this will remove any line containing either '--mem' or
   # 'another-string' from the job submission script
   cluster = YourCluster(
       header_skip=['--mem', 'another-string'],
       **other_options_go_here)


An example of this problem is very well detailed in this `blog post
<https://blog.dask.org/2019/08/28/dask-on-summit#invalid-operations-in-the-job-script>`_
by Matthew Rocklin. In his case, the error was:

.. code-block:: text

   Command:
   bsub /tmp/tmp4874eufw.sh
   stdout:
   
   Typical usage:
   	bsub [LSF arguments] jobscript
   	bsub [LSF arguments] -Is $SHELL
   	bsub -h[elp] [options]
   	bsub -V
   
   NOTES:
    * All jobs must specify a walltime (-W) and project id (-P)
    * Standard jobs must specify a node count (-nnodes) or -ln_slots. These jobs cannot specify a resource string (-R).
    * Expert mode jobs (-csm y) must specify a resource string and cannot specify -nnodes or -ln_slots.
   
   stderr:
   ERROR: Resource strings (-R) are not supported in easy mode. Please resubmit without a resource string.
   ERROR: -n is no longer supported. Please request nodes with -nnodes.
   ERROR: No nodes requested. Please request nodes with -nnodes.

Another example of this issue is this github `issue
<https://github.com/dask/dask-jobqueue/issues/238>`_ where ``--mem`` is not an
accepted option on some SLURM clusters. The error was something like this:

.. code-block:: text

  $sbatch submit_slurm.sh
  sbatch: error: Memory specification can not be satisfied
  sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested node configuration is not available
